Blinky (red) is very aggressive and hard to shake once he gets behind you, 
Blinky's is the most simple and direct, using Pac-Man's current tile as his target.


Pinky  (pink) tends to get in front of you and cut you off, 
Pinky behaves as he does because he does not target Pac-Man's tile directly. 
Instead, he selects an offset four tiles away from Pac-Man in the direction Pac-Man is currently moving (with one exception).

If Pac-Man is moving left, Pinky's target tile will be four game tiles to the left of Pac-Man's current tile.
The same is true for right, up, down



Inky   (light blue) is the least predictable of the bunch, 
Inky first calculates a target tile that is two tiles ahead of Pac-Man's current direction. 
This position is chosen to make it appear as if Inky is "ambushing" Pac-Man.

Then, Inky considers the position of Blinky, the red ghost. 
It takes the tile that is opposite to Blinky's current direction (the tile on the other side of Blinky) 
from its current position.

Inky uses a weighted combination of these two positions 
the tile two ahead of Pac-Man and the one opposite to Blinky) to determine its actual target tile. 
The exact formula for this combination might differ slightly between various versions of the game, 
but it generally involves calculating a position that is a certain distance (typically halfway) 
between these two calculated points.


Clyde  (orange) seems to do his own thing and stay out of the way.




Scatter Mode: In this mode, the ghosts have specific pre-defined locations on the game board where 
they aim to go. Each ghost has its own scatter corner where it moves to when the game is in scatter mode. 
This behavior is generally used to create patterns in the ghost's movements and give players a chance to 
strategize around predictable ghost locations.

Frightened Mode: When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue and enter frightened mode.
In this state, the ghosts become vulnerable, and their behavior changes. 
Instead of chasing Pac-Man, they will try to avoid him and move in a random or less predictable manner.



The order of preference for choosing which ghost's counter to activate is: Pinky, then Inky, and then Clyde.
